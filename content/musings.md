*Random (and occasionally unintelligible) thoughts of mine.*

# December 2022

* Spam email is a great case study in why an unfiltered and unmoderated public
  network leads to a bad user experience.

* What's the manufacturing/baking lead time for Girl Scout cookies? What's
  their true shelf life?

* I'm waiting for a programming language that has a Rust-like syntax but uses a
  Go-like runtime. Gleam looks interesting.

* Restaurants should offer discounts if I bring back the take-out containers
  from a previous order.

* A penalty shootout is a rather terrible way to decide a football game but
  it's certainly not the worst possible option.

* Does there exist a point in time when computing technology ceases to be
  useful and becomes a societal burden? Have we reached or passed this point
  yet? Already today certain industries have argueably become societally
  negative, but on the whole I believe computing is still a positive to
  society. When will the overall sentiment turn negative and will it be in my
  lifetime? How long will it take us to realize what has happened?
