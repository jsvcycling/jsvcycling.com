*Random (and occasionally unintelligible) thoughts of mine.*

# 2022

* **December 19th, 2022:** A penalty shootout is a rather terrible way to
  decide a football game but it's certainly not the worst possible option.

* **December 19th, 2022:** Does there exist a point in time when computing
  technology ceases to be useful and becomes a societal burden? Have we reached
  or passed this point yet? Already today certain industries have argueably
  become societally negative, but on the whole I believe computing is still a
  positive to society. When will the overall sentiment turn negative and will
  it be in my lifetime? How long will it take us to realize what has happened?
