  "Who is John Galt? When he says that he will stop the motor of the world, is he a destroyer or a liberator? Why does he have to fight his battles not against his enemies but against those who need him most? Why does he fight his hardest battle against the woman he loves?",
  "You will know the answer to these questions when you discover the reason behind the baffling events that play havoc with the lives of the amazing men and women in this book. You will discover why a productive genius becomes a worthless playboy... why a great steel industrtialist is working for his own destruction... why a composer gives up his career on the night of his triumph... why a beautiful woman who runs a transcontiental railroad falls in love with the man she has sworn to kill.",
  "Atlas Shrugged, a modern classic and a perennial Ayn Rand bestseller, offers the reader the spectacle of human greatness, depicted with all the poetry and power of one of the the twentieth century's leading artists."
